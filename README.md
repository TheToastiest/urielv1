URIEL V1 - Cognitive Core Prototype

Overview

URIEL V1 is the foundational prototype of the Unified Reflective Intelligence and Emergent Learning system, a deterministic cognitive framework built to reason across multimodal data, self-reflect, and adapt its behavior without relying on traditional inference-based language models.

URIEL integrates:

A modular cognitive bus (Corpus Callosum) for inter-process reasoning.

A neural-symbolic runtime with dynamic drive evaluation.

A semantic memory engine with causal traceability and veracity scoring.

Early PFC/Thalamus routing and hippocampal memory persistence.

This release represents the first closed-source public build, exposing the architecture and evaluation pipeline for demonstration and internal benchmarking only.

Core Features

Deterministic cognitive routing through the Callosum bus.

Structured episodic memory backed by SQLite (semantic_memory.db).

Contrastive and autoencoding vector backends via Burn and FAISS.

Modular component graph (Thalamus → PFC → Hippocampus → Corpus).

Rust and C++ hybrid architecture, designed for full cross-system integration.
